# MetricGAN-U Recipe for Enhancement

This recipe implements MetricGAN-U recipe for enhancement as described in the paper
[MetricGAN-U: Unsupervised speech enhancement/ dereverberation based only on noisy/ reverberated speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05866)

!!! Note: To access DNSMOS, you have to ask the key from the DNS organizer first: dns_challenge@microsoft.com !!!

Use the `download_vctk` function in `voicebank_prepare.py` to download the dataset
and resample it to 16000 Hz. To run an experiment, execute the following command in
the current folder:

```bash
python train.py hparams/train_dnsmos.yaml --data_folder /path/to/data_folder
```
