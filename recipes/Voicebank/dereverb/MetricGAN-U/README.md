# MetricGAN-U Recipe for dereverberation

This recipe implements MetricGAN-U recipe for dereverberation as described in the paper
[MetricGAN-U: Unsupervised speech enhancement/ dereverberation based only on noisy/ reverberated speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05866)

Notes:
1- By default we use srmr as a default target metric. This requires you to install SRMRpy (see extra-dependecies.txt)
2- To use dnsmos as a target metric, you have to ask the key from the DNS organizer first: dns_challenge@microsoft.com

# Dataset
Please "Manually" Download VoiceBank-SLR dataset from [here](https://bio-asplab.citi.sinica.edu.tw/Opensource.html#VB-SLR):

# How to run
To run an experiment, execute the following command in
the current folder:

```bash
python train.py hparams/train_dereverb.yaml --data_folder /path/to/data_folder
```

## Results
Experiment Date | Hyperparams file | PESQ | SRMR |
-|-|-|-|
2021-10-31 | train_dereverb.yaml | 2.07 | 8.265 |
